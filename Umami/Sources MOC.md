# Sources MOC
Use tags instead of MOCs, unless you have a specific reason to create a new MOC.

Here are the types of sources I'm noting, generally from most relevant and important to least.

#source/bookðŸ“š
#source/movieðŸŽ¬
#source/paperðŸ“‘
#source/playðŸŽ­ 
#source/paintingðŸ–¼ 
#source/speechðŸ—£ 
#source/poemðŸ”– 
#source/articleðŸ—ž

### Commentary
Do I really need the emojis? No, I don't. But this is the one area where they really don't get in the way. Notice that the emoji is at the end of the tag name, so they don't get in the way of the auto-complete feature once I start typing `#source`.
